Chatoms-RubyMotion
==================

Our conversation starter app, written in RubyMotion

This project is provided with only 50 conversation starters, but using the actual RubyMotion code base from our 2.0 application rewrite.  We've made this code available to the public for educational purposes, but retain copywrites to the application source and content.
